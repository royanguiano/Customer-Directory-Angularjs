# customerRecords
Description: 
This application is built on Angularjs framework. 
The libraries that were used here were the following: 
- Materializejs
- jquery 
- favicons
- Node
- express 
The application uses two way binding with custom directives and dependencies like: http, resources, log, scope. I used different ajax methods to get, delete data from a json object of records.
